# DeepGDel: Deep Learning-based Gene Deletion Prediction Framework for Growth-Coupled Production in Genome-Scale Metabolic Models

## About DeepGDel
DeepGDel is a framework for predicting gene deletion strategies for growth-coupled production in genome-scale metabolic models.
It enables the use of deep learning algorithms to learn from sequential data on genes and metabolites, allowing the automatic prediction of gene deletion strategies for growth-coupled production in a data-driven manner.

DeepGDel consists of three neural network-based modules: (1) **Meta-M**, which sets up a metabolite representation learning task to learn the characteristics of metabolites in the metabolic model; (2) **Gene-M**, which sets up a gene representation learning task to learn the characteristics of genes in the metabolic model; and (3) **Pred-M**, which integrates the latent representations of metabolite and gene characteristics in a pairwise manner to predict gene deletion states and outputs the final gene deletion strategy.

## Necessary Environments

To use DeepGDel, you need the following core environment setup with the recommended versions:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (Version 3.12)
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) (Version 2.2.2)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (Version 2.17.0)

Additional auxiliary Python packages (e.g., pandas, numpy) are specified in the source code.

You can also install the required dependencies using pip.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're using other than CUDA 11.7, you may need to install PyTorch for the proper version of CUDA. See [instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for more details.

## Datasets and Data Download

The maximal gene deletion strategy data (specifying a metabolic model and a target metabolite) can be downloaded from [MetNetComp](https://metnetcomp.github.io/database1/indexFiles/index.html) via the following URL:

```
https://metnetcomp.github.io/database1/csv/<model>&<target metabolite>&core.csv
```
For example, to download the maximal gene deletion strategy of succ_e in the e_coli_core model, change the last part of the above link to ’/e_coli_core&succ_e.csv’.

The gene deletion strategy data for each metabolite in the three studied models, used as ground-truth labels, are available in the following file: `Data/<model>/Label`.

The amino acid data corresponding to each gene in the three studied metabolic models downloaded from the [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) database, used as framework input (Gene-M module), are available in the following file: `Data/<model>/Gene_AA`.

The SMILES data corresponding to each metabolite in the three studied metabolic models downloaded from the [MetaNetX](https://www.metanetx.org/) database, used as framework input (Meta-M module), are available in the following file: `Data/<model>/Target metabolites_smile.csv`.

Note: Please unzip the individual CSV file `Data/<model>/Label/<metabolite_name>.csv` from `Data/<model>/Label/Label.zip` using the following command:

```
unzip Data/<model>/Label/Label.zip -d Data/<model>/Label/;
```

Similarly, unzip the individual CSV file for amino acid data `Data/<model>/Gene_AA/<gene_name>.csv`, from `Data/<model>/Gene_AA/Gene_AA.zip` using the following command:

```
unzip Data/<model>/Gene_AA/Gene_AA.zip -d Data/<model>/Gene_AA/;
```

## Predicting Gene Deletion Strategies with DeepGDel

The main file `DeepGDel_main.py` provides the full implementation of the DeepGDel framework. It calls the module components `GeneLSTM.py`, `MetaLSTM.py`, and `CombinedModel.py` in the `model` directory to implement the designed three modules.

1. Function `GeneLSTM(nn.Module)` and `MetaLSTM(nn.Module)`

These two functions serve as the learning models in **Gene-M** and **Meta-M** components in the DeepGDel framework. 
They are responsible for encoding input genes and metabolites' sequential data using an **LSTM-based autoencoder**.  
They consist of the following key components:

- Embedding Layer: Converts input sequence indices into dense vector representations of size `vocab_embedding_dim`.

- LSTM Encoder: Processes the embedded sequences and captures temporal dependencies; Outputs hidden states for each time step.

- Layer Normalization: Normalizes LSTM outputs to stabilize training and improve generalization.

- Mean Pooling & Fully Connected Layer: Summarizes sequence features by taking the mean over time steps; Maps the summarized features to a fixed-size hidden representation.

- LSTM Decoder: Reconstructs the original input sequence from the learned hidden representations.

- Output Projection: Maps the decoded LSTM outputs back to the original vocabulary size; Uses `argmax` to predict the most likely token at each time step.

2. Function `CombinedModel(nn.Module)`

This function serve as the **Pred-M** integrates GeneLSTM and MetaLSTM for joint feature learning in the DeepGDel framework. 
It is responsible for extracting sequence representations and performing gene deletion status prediction.

It consists of the following key components:

- Feature Fusion: Combines learned representations via element-wise multiplication.
- Fully Connected Layer: Maps the fused feature representation to a single output neuron.
- Binary Classification Output: Uses a sigmoid activation function to make the final prediction.
- Reconstruction Capability: If trainable, reconstructs the original gene and metabolite sequences.

For more detailed information, please refer to the **comments within the source code**.

## Output Details

DeepGDel saves the output gene deletion strategies as a CSV file in the following directory: `Data/<model>/Results/all_metabolites_predictions.csv`.

The output CSV represents a **Metabolite × Gene** matrix, where:

- The first column lists the target metabolites.
- The remaining columns represent a binary (0/1) vector indicating which genes should be deleted:
  - `0` → Gene **to be deleted**.
  - `1` → Gene **to remain**.

## Example Code for Quick Run

### Quick Run on the e_coli_core Model

We provide three scripts to run example tests on the e_coli_core model with DeepGDel and two baseline methods:

-  `quick_run_DeepGDel.py`: predicting gene deletion strategies with DeepGDel on e_coli_core model.
-  `quick_run_baseline_BPM.py`: predicting gene deletion strategies with the baseline method (BPM) on e_coli_core model.
-  `quick_run_baseline_DNN.py`: predicting gene deletion strategies with the baseline method (DNN) on e_coli_core model.

You can run the test scripts (which default to running computations on the CPU) using the following commands:

```
python3 quick_run_DeepGDel.py;
```
```
python3 quick_run_baseline_BPM.py;
```
```
python3 quick_run_baseline_DNN.py;
```

Note: Please unzip the e_coli_core data before testing using the following commands:

```
unzip Data/e_coli_core/Gene_AA/Gene_AA.zip -d Data/e_coli_core/Gene_AA/;
unzip Data/e_coli_core/Label/Label.zip -d Data/e_coli_core/Label/;
```

### Quick Run Reports and Outputs

The quick run scripts above generate a performance report, i.e., **DeepGDel Report** or **Baseline Report**, including five performance metrics: Overall Accuracy, Macro-Averaged Precision, Macro-Averaged Recall, Macro-Averaged F1-score, and AUC.
The DeepGDel test script additionally saves the resulting gene deletion strategies for e_coli_core as a CSV file in the following directory: `Data/e_coli_core/Results/all_metabolites_predictions_temp.csv`.


## Visualization of Feature Representations Using PCA and t-SNE

The figure below shows dimensionality reduction results for the original input features and the DeepGDel learned latent representations.

- **Top row:** 2D PCA projections
- **Bottom row:** 2D t-SNE projections
- Points are colored by deletion status:
  - **Blue:** Deleted (label = 0)
  - **Red:** Non-deleted (label = 1)

This visualization qualitatively demonstrates that the learned latent features separate deletion states better than the original features.

## Complementary: Learning Model Training and Ablations

### (1) Learning Model Training

We provide functions for **training learning models within the DeepGDel framework**, making it easy to apply and extend DeepGDel to additional models or datasets.
The main script, `training_main.py`, and its dependency functions are in the `trainer` folder.

After training, the model's state dictionary, which includes all trainable parameters (such as weights and biases), is stored in the `train_disc` folder as a `.sav` file. 
This file is generated by the `torch.save` function, which is provided by PyTorch, and is used to serialize and save the model's learned parameters for future use.

1. Function `train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, epochs, lr, device)`:

Trains the given model using the specified training and validation datasets.

- model (nn.Module): The model to train.
- train_loader (DataLoader): DataLoader for the training set.
- val_loader (DataLoader): DataLoader for the validation set.
- epochs (int): Number of training epochs.
- lr (float): Learning rate for the optimizer.
- device (str or torch.device): The device for training (cpu or cuda).

3. Function `save_model_with_confirmation(model, CBM)`

Save a PyTorch model only after receiving explicit confirmation. 

- model (torch.nn.Module): The PyTorch model to be saved.
- CBM (str): A unique identifier used to name the saved model file.

### (2) Learning Model Ablations

We provide functions for **learning models ablations within the DeepGDel framework** to explore the further impact on different learning models in two designed modules.
The functions are built-in by default with the above `training_main.py` script, and its dependency functions are in the `model` folder.

1. Function `freeze_model(model)`:

Prevents a PyTorch model’s parameters from being updated during training by freezing all layers, also working with pre-trained models.

- model (nn.Module): The PyTorch model whose parameters will be frozen.

2. Function `is_model_frozen(model)`:

Checks whether all parameters in a PyTorch model are frozen, meaning none of them require gradient updates.

- model (nn.Module): The PyTorch model to check.
